# Hi There, I'm Vincent!
I'm a software engineer based in Sydney, Australia. I studied Computer Science
and Mathematics at [UNSW](https://unsw.edu.au) and have worked in various software development roles:
- Software Engineer at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) (January 2022 - Present).
- Software Engineer Intern at [IMC Trading](https://www.imc.com/ap/) (December 2021 - February 2022).
- Junior Developer at [Ventia](https://www.ventia.com/) (September 2019 - November 2021).

I am interested in all aspects of software engineering and learning new techniques to write elegant, secure and scalable software solutions. I primarily develop software in:
- Rust: high performance and parallel applications.
- Python - web backends, automation scripts and data analysis tools.
- Javascript/Typescript: full stack web applications.

and also have experience in Java and C++.

Outside of coding, I'm also an avid [speedcuber](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2014WONG08). I have attained [national championship podiums](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2014WONG08?tab=championship-podiums) and am [ranked top 20 worldwide in one-handed solving](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2014WONG08?tab=results-by-event&event=333oh).

On this site, you will find various of my software projects as well as notes
written for some of the UNSW computing courses I have taken.
