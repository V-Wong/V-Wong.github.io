# ðŸ‘‹ Hi There, I'm Vincent!
I'm currently a software engineer at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) in Sydney, Australia. Before that, I studied applied mathematics
and computer science at [UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). While studying, I took up roles as:
- Software Engineer Intern at [IMC Trading](https://www.imc.com/ap/) (December 2021 - February 2022).
- Software Developer (Part Time) at [Ventia](https://www.ventia.com/) (September 2019 - November 2021).

I primarily develop software in:
- Rust: high performance and parallel applications.
- Java: large-scale enterprise applications.
- Python - web backends, automation scripts and data analysis tools.
- Javascript/Typescript: full stack web applications.

Outside of coding, I'm an avid [speedcuber](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2014WONG08) with [national championship podiums](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2014WONG08?tab=championship-podiums).
