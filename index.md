# Hi There, I'm Vincent!
I'm currently a backend software engineer at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) in Sydney, Australia. Before that, I studied applied mathematics and computer science at [UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). While studying, I took up roles as:
- Software Engineer Intern at [IMC Trading](https://www.imc.com/ap/) (December 2021 - February 2022).
- Casual Software Developer at [Ventia](https://www.ventia.com/) (September 2019 - November 2021).

Outside of work, I have worked on projects in a variety of languages including:
- Rust: [CubeSimRS](https://github.com/V-Wong/CubeSimRS) and [ra-evaluator](https://github.com/V-Wong/ra-evaluator).
- Python: [CubeSimPy](https://github.com/V-Wong/CubeSim) and [LZ78 Encoder](https://github.com/V-Wong/MATH3411/blob/master/LZ78.py).
- JavaScript/TypeScript: [Huffman Encoding Visualiser](https://vwong.dev/Huffman-Encoding/) and [LinkUp Events](https://linkupevents.com/).

When not coding, I like to [speedcube](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2014WONG08) and have held [national championship podiums](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2014WONG08?tab=championship-podiums).
