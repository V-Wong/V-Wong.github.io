# Hi There!
I'm Vincent, a software engineer based in Sydney, Australia. I currently study Computer Science
and Mathematics at [UNSW](https://unsw.edu.au) and have worked in various software development roles:
- Junior Developer at [Ventia](https://www.ventia.com/) (September 2019 - November 2021)
- Software Engineer Intern at [IMC Trading](https://www.imc.com/ap/) (December 2021 - February 2022)

I am interested in all aspects of software engineering and learning new techniques to write elegant, secure and scalable software solutions. 
I primarily develop software in
- Rust
- Python
- Javascript/Typescript

and also have project experience in Java and C++.

On this site, you will find various of my software projects as well as notes
written for the UNSW computing courses I have taken.
